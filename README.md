Hello, welcome to the project's readme document.
This project utilises a full-stack framework, incorporating Django, Python, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. My objective is to develop a responsive website that enables me, as the site owner, to perform CRUD operations to make updating my portfolio simple. This project is to be my own personal website to promote myself as a web developer.

# Overview

This website is to act as major promotional point for me entering the market as a Full Stack Developer, it is to communicate value to visitors. The site is to be under construction for a while and the current state of the site represents the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) having been reached. It is a starting point for further development, with new features planned to help me organise my workflow in the back end. More content is to be added after some websites have been built for real world use (initially these websites will be built for free) and the blog articles have their full content in place. The website being built as a final project piece for a fullstack bootcamp is specified to require CRUD functionality. This is fulfilled here by making a gated dashboard (only available to superuser), where portfolio entries can be uploaded, edited and deleted as required. This is akin to functionality already present in django admin but, it is accessed faster and has a nicer UI. This aims to make the experience of updating the site both faster and more enjoyable and has set the stage for future dashboard functions to be added, such as To Do Lists.

# UX

For the UX planning I researched by web searching other people offering web developer services in Carmarthenshire. I decided to go with a clean, simple and personable approach, while showcasing some design abilities


The target market for 'c-sparks-fly.net' includes:

- Individuals wanting websites built.
- Small to medium sized businesses, whose requirements are most likely to fall within my skillset.
- Recruiters who may be visiting while scouting for potential employees.
- Other developers, who may mention the site to colleagues and this lead to networking or other opportunities.

These users will be looking for:

- A website that provides context and shows my ability as a developer.
- Examples of my work.
- The ability to contact me easily if they want to.
- A visually appealing experience.
- A user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation to access content and resources.
- The ability to post, comment and like events an provide feedback reviews.
- Links to explore my work further.


The website currently provides these features. The design is colorful without being overwhelming and suited to having good visibility on monitors and screens in a variety of lighting conditions. The site being database driven and with image static files being accessed by cloudinary has a fast load time.
